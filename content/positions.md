## Positions

Ordent Systems is a small, early-stage organization focused on long-horizon technical work.  
We are selective about who we work with and intentional about how collaboration happens.

This page describes the **type of people**, not specific roles.

---

## Who We Look For

We are interested in individuals who:

- Think in systems rather than features  
- Prefer clarity, structure, and reasoning over speed for its own sake  
- Are comfortable working on problems that are not yet fully defined  
- Can operate with limited external validation or direction  
- Value correctness, discipline, and long-term outcomes  

Titles, seniority, and conventional role boundaries matter less than how someone thinks and works.

## Areas of Interest

From time to time, we engage with people whose backgrounds intersect with:

- Software systems and infrastructure  
- Applied mathematics and formal reasoning  
- Engineering disciplines involving constraints and optimization  
- Technical writing, documentation, or specification work  
- Operational, legal, or organizational structure  

Specific responsibilities are defined only after mutual alignment.

## How We Work

Ordent Systems favors:

- Small teams  
- Clear ownership  
- Deliberate decision-making  
- Written communication  
- Thoughtful tradeoffs over rapid iteration  

We do not optimize for constant visibility, hype, or scale-for-scale’s-sake.

## Engagement Model

Engagements may take different forms, including:

- Short-term exploratory collaboration  
- Academic or research-adjacent work  
- Advisory or consultative relationships  
- Long-term roles as the organization matures  

All substantive work occurs privately and under appropriate agreements.
